# Nodejs API 

 quickly start a new API only project. This does not have a lots of wasted code. Just Point Blank Basic System.

This is based on Restify Framework, and is just meant to shorten your time to start work.

### Installation
+ Clone the repo
+ Install using npm install
+ Create a api/config.js from api/config_sample.js
+ Update the paramaters in api/config.js
+ Done, now start using npm start. 

This should give you a basic api at 9999 (If you have not changed the port). Hit the URL printed on Console and verify if its running.

### Extending to use the system
+ Just add as many routes into the api/routes folder
+ Restart the node processs
+ Thats it, as simple as that

### Testing Api
+ Added json file in project
+ Use Extension Thunder for api testing or postman
+ Added postman json file in project
+ You can use postman for api testing
